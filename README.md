# USE WITH DEVELOPMENT VERSION LCI (USES LOLCODE 1.3)
# Wat
Random lolcode stuff, for now only has counting + quick sort. I don't think I'll add more. Just a reference to keep up there to add on to the very scarce lolcode resource.

# Why?
At least for now, this is for a class assignment:
Analysis of Algorithms. My professor requires us to "test" an algorithm and write a report on it.
I decided to experiment with counting sort and quick sort.

# files
Note that only final.lol produce outputs; the rest of the .lol files are used for runtime checking only. See ./test.sh (no virus trust me!!11!!one!!)
